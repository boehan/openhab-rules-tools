# To Today
A rule template that will search for all Items with a given tag that is a DateTimeItem.
Those Items that are found are filtered to only those with a valid DateTime and moves those that are in the past to today's date.
DST is accounted for. See the entry in the [Marketplace](https://community.openhab.org/t/to-today/127921).
